            <h2>The Indigenous Roots of Baguio</h2>
            <p>Before becoming a bustling city, the area now known as Baguio was home to the Ibaloi and Kankanaey peoples, indigenous groups of the Cordillera region. They referred to the area as "Kafagway," meaning "wide-open grassland." These communities lived in small farming settlements, cultivating rice and root crops, and engaged in trade with neighboring tribes. Their traditions, such as the "cañao" ritual, played a vital role in their social and spiritual lives. Despite Spanish colonization efforts in the 16th century, the Cordillera highlands remained largely autonomous, as the indigenous peoples resisted Spanish rule.</p>

            <h2>American Influence and the Birth of Baguio City</h2>
            <p>The transformation of Baguio began with the arrival of the Americans in the early 1900s. Recognizing the potential of its cool climate, they developed Baguio as a hill station—a retreat from the tropical heat of the lowlands. Daniel Burnham, a prominent American architect, designed the city with a "garden city" concept, incorporating parks, wide roads, and scenic landscapes.</p>
            <p>In 1909, Baguio was officially established as a chartered city and declared the summer capital of the Philippines. To improve accessibility, the Americans constructed Kennon Road, a challenging engineering feat that connected the city to the lowlands. They also established Camp John Hay, a rest and recreation facility for American officials and military personnel.</p>

            <h2>World War II and the City's Resilience</h2>
            <p>During World War II, Baguio played a significant role as both a Japanese stronghold and a site of major battles. The city suffered extensive bombing, resulting in widespread destruction. However, after the war, Baguio was rebuilt and regained its status as an important cultural, educational, and tourism center.</p>
